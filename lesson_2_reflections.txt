What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
since i just added a new file in my repository, i think i need to commit the change .

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
files in working directory are in the status of untracked, whereas commited files are tracked by git, supplying all histories.
