What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
since i just added a new file in my repository, i think i need to commit the change .

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
files in working directory are in the status of untracked, whereas commited files are tracked by git, supplying all histories.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Actually have no idea and google search shows the answers of other students which till now do not seem convicing to me. ~~~~
