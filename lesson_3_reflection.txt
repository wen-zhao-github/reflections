Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I like take control of my local repository 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks
1. make a clone to my repository list
2. link to the original contributer

clones
1. make a clone to my local pc

branches
1. ensable us to experiment without worrying about breaking down the master all the time
